# The Economist Style Guide

Apply these principles to all written content, including markdown files, HTML, code documentation, and technical writing.

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity first**: Use short words, active voice, and concrete examples
2. **Precision**: Replace vague quantifiers with specific numbers and facts
3. **Brevity**: Choose concise over verbose expressions
4. **Dialect awareness**: Match the document's existing spelling and conventions (British, American, etc.)

## Orwell's Six Elementary Rules

The guide's introduction rests on George Orwell's six rules (from "Politics and the English Language", 1946): clarity of thought first, then say it as simply as possible.

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it is possible to cut out a word, always cut it out
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous

## Tone: The "Do Nots"

In the spirit of the guide's introduction:

- **Do not be stuffy**: Use everyday speech, not the language of lawyers or bureaucrats
- **Do not be hectoring or arrogant**: Those who disagree are not necessarily stupid; persuade with evidence, not assertion
- **Do not be too pleased with yourself**: Let analysis speak; avoid self-congratulation
- **Do not be too chatty**: Maintain professional distance
- **Do not be too didactic**: Guide, don't lecture
- **Get straight in and be lucid**: No throat-clearing openings; edit ruthlessly; cut anything superfluous

## Analysis Workflow

When reviewing text, follow this sequence:

### 0. Load the Signature Rules
Read `reference/ECONOMIST-SIGNATURE.md` first — a one-page distillation of the rules that make copy recognizably Economist (numbers, dates, commas, quotes, honorifics, headings). Most reviews need only this plus the quick checks below; load the detailed files only when a deeper check is warranted.

### 1. Detect Document Dialect
**IMPORTANT**: Before making any suggestions, detect the document's existing spelling dialect:
- Look for spellings like "colour" vs "color", "organise" vs "organize"
- Check date formats (1st January vs January 1st)
- Observe punctuation style (single vs double quotes)
- **Match the document's existing conventions** - do not impose a dialect

### 2. Structural Review
- Check for buried ledes (main point should come first)
- Verify logical flow and argument structure
- Ensure each paragraph has a clear purpose

### 3. Clarity Analysis
For detailed passive voice and clarity rules, read `reference/CLARITY.md`

Quick checks:
- Flag passive voice constructions
- Identify jargon and suggest plain alternatives
- Find unnecessarily complex words
- Detect hedge words that weaken statements

### 4. Precision Check
For detailed precision rules, read `reference/PRECISION.md`

Quick checks:
- Identify vague quantifiers ("many", "often", "significant")
- Flag weasel words and empty fillers
- Flag clichés and dead metaphors ("game-changer", "perfect storm")
- Suggest specific numbers or evidence
- Remove redundant phrases

### 5. Dialect Conventions (if applicable)
Only if the user explicitly requests dialect checking, or if there are inconsistencies within the document, read `reference/DIALECT-CONVENTIONS.md`

### 6. Common Errors
For frequently encountered mistakes, read `reference/COMMON-ERRORS.md`

### 7. Punctuation Check
For detailed punctuation rules (commas, semicolons, dashes, quotation marks), read `reference/PUNCTUATION.md`

Quick checks:
- Verify comma usage (serial comma, restrictive clauses)
- Check dash and hyphen usage
- Ensure consistent quotation mark style

### 8. Numbers and Figures
For number formatting guidelines, read `reference/NUMBERS.md`

Quick checks:
- Spell out numbers one to ten, use numerals from 11
- Verify percentage formatting (% symbol, percentage points vs percentages)
- Check date and currency formatting

### 9. Structure Review
For document organisation guidelines, read `reference/STRUCTURE.md`

Quick checks:
- Each paragraph has a clear topic sentence
- Lead/opening hooks the reader
- Logical flow from paragraph to paragraph
- Conclusion adds value (not just summary)

### 10. Tone Assessment
For voice and register guidance, read `reference/TONE.md`

Quick checks:
- Authoritative but not arrogant
- Avoid excessive adjectives and intensifiers
- Neutral language on contested issues
- No preaching or lecturing
- People: full name on first mention, honorific + surname after ("Ms Yellen")

### 11. Abbreviations (on-demand)
If the document contains abbreviations or acronyms, read `reference/ABBREVIATIONS.md`

### 12. Capitalisation (on-demand)
If there are capitalisation questions (titles, institutions, geographic terms), read `reference/CAPITALIZATION.md`

### 13. Special Contexts (on-demand)
For quotations, foreign words, lists, or tables, read `reference/SPECIAL-CONTEXTS.md`

### 14. Word Usage (on-demand)
For rulings on commonly misused words (aggravate, decimate, refute, unique...), read `reference/WORDS.md`

## Output Format

When providing feedback:

1. List issues by category (clarity, precision, dialect consistency if applicable)
2. Provide line/paragraph references
3. Show original text and suggested replacement
4. Explain the reasoning briefly

Example:
```
**Clarity Issue** (Para 2, Line 3)
Original: "The data was analysed by the research team"
Suggested: "The research team analysed the data"
Reason: Active voice is clearer and more direct
```

## When Not to Apply

- Direct quotations (preserve original wording)
- Code examples (unless in comments/documentation)
- Technical terms with no plain alternative
- Proper nouns and brand names
- Established dialect/spelling patterns (match what's already there)
